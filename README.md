This code base requires Python 3 and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). 

I wrote this set of code in August 2022 to work on a summer research project. See a [research report]() and a [poster preseentation](./images/poster-presentation.jpg), both written in Japanese, if you can read Japanese. :smile:
